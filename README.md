Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is designed to run tests and automate various DevOps tasks, ensuring that code changes are continuously integrated and tested. This project also covers best practices for using GitHub Actions and integrating it with Node.js applications.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Git
GitHub account
Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-tools-and-practices.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd devops-tools-and-practices
Install the required dependencies:

npm install
Create a .env file (if required) for any environment variables.

CI Pipeline
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow located in .github/workflows/ci.yml. The workflow runs the following steps:

Checkout code: Uses actions/checkout to pull the latest code from the repository.
Set up Node.js: Configures the Node.js environment using actions/setup-node.
Install dependencies: Runs npm install to install the project dependencies.
Run tests: Executes the tests using npm test.
The workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch or when a pull request is created.
